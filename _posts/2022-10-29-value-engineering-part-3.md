Like every tool, value engineering should be used with a set of best practices to make the most of it. Everything in the process matters: language, timing, stakeholders, etc. In the previous blogs, I shared [6 reasons why value engineering should belong to every Presales toolbox](https://www.datacrafts.fr/value-engineering-part-1/) and [I gave some practical examples of tools every Presales can build](https://www.datacrafts.fr/value-engineering-part-2/). In this third and last blog, I’ll share with you some best practices to follow when you use these tools.

## Best practices
### 1) Stay focused on the strategic value

When you start in your Value Engineering journey, it is easy to fall into the trap of talking about your product and its technical differentiators (faster queries, higher scale, better UI/UX, etc) rather than the value it brings. Another common trap is to include too many value drivers which gets stakeholders confused and skeptical. Your real value is diluted. Value engineering should focus on the strategic value only.

The value pyramid is a great framework to focus on your customer’s strategic value. It is a mental model that shifts the discussions from solutions and product features up to the Corporate and Business Objectives.  It is safe to consider that every customer you're working with are focused on one of the three strategic goals: increase revenue, reduce costs or reduce risks. Your value analysis should start with one of these drivers and break it down to a level where you can **map and measure the impact** of your solution. More on the measure later.

Let’s take the following example. You are selling a fast analytics platform to a bank. What you are the most excited about is how your solution will improve the customer experience through better product recommendations. However, you know that your prospect’s strategic objective that drives this initiative is cost reduction. Here, you should focus on cost reduction. A good example of this is how your solution can reduce the time it takes a fraud analyst to decide if they should block or release a suspect transaction and how this translates into cost reduction for the fraud department.

### 2) Keep it simple

The purpose of value engineering is to justify why a customer should give you their money and what they will get out of it. The most elegant VE tools are the simplest ones. They have the advantage of being easy to build and easy to understand. A common trap is to build an advanced economical modelisation of their business that only a PhD in economics can understand. By venturing into a complex model, you will need more inputs, take more assumptions and increase the risk of shooting yourself in the foot.

Let’s go back to our previous fraud analysis example. You may be tempted to measure how your solution can process understructed and high cardinality data and reduce the rate of false positives and false negatives. This will definitely lead to a better cost reduction. However, this will make the study much more complex. The stakeholders won’t trust the results if they do not understand the details. 

### 3) Get your champion involved

Every VE study requires several inputs such as the average cost of acquiring a new customer, the revenue increase by having an additional feature, the fine to pay in case of compliance issues, etc. This information is often confidential and hard to get. Your champion plays a key role here. They will be able to provide you with key insights and guidance on these numbers to start with realistic assumptions. If they don't have them, a champion will go to get them from people that know the answers. It has the additional benefit of testing your champion.

The final objective of the Value Engineering study is to present your findings to your customer’s exec. It is common that this presentation lies on the shoulders of your champion. You won’t even be in the room when they do it. This is why involving the champion early in the process is key. They need to feel involved and accountable. They will put their reputation (and sometimes their job) to defend your solution. Even if you are the one presenting the study, your champion will be in the room and can intervene if you get challenged. If your champion is not comfortable with the inputs or the outcomes of the study, you can forget about your deal. 

### 4) Use the customer langage

When working with your Champion in the study, make sure you keep an eye (ear?) on the language they use. This may seem like a minor thing, but trust me, it is not. The same study, leading to the same result, will be much more impactful when built from the customer point of view and uses their language. 

Every customer thinks that they are unique. They will use their own words to describe industry standards. They will group things under a high visibility project name. They may create new acronyms or keywords for this project. Just embrace it. Customize the VE tool for them and use their keywords. Also, keep in mind that your product is just a part of a solution they are building. Talk about their solution instead of your product. 

This is a low energy task that has three benefits:
- It makes everything easier to understand and to communicate
- It avoids mis-understanding and wrong assumptions
- More importantly, it helps your customer to project themself in a world where they use your product. It’s their world with your product. Not your world.

### 5) Be quantitative and objective

If you finish your VE study and the result is something like: we will drastically reduce your cost, we will improve your efficiency or we will give you a better user experience, then you missed the heart of the exercise. For VE to be powerful, you need to focus on measurable outputs. The number of dollars saved per month, the number of new customers acquired or protected from churn, the increase in the company valuation are few examples of what your output should look like. A number that everyone understands and can measure. If you impact a metric M, make sure that you know its current value. You will always have non quantifiable value that you bring. Share them at the end like the cherry on the cake. They can not be the cake.

### 6) Consider several options

It is frequent that your champion won’t be able to get you some of the data you need to build your model. To move forward, you have to take assumptions. You can use industry standards and benchmarks. Consulting firms publish updated studies on every field you can think of. You can also suggest educated guesses based on your experience working on similar projects or customers. If you helped several banks save an average of 30% of their cost when complying with the new risk regulation, there’s a big chance that you won’t be too far from this number with this new bank you want to work with. 

This being said, make sure you validate all your hypotheses with your champion. They can tell you if these assumptions make sense in their context. They can challenge you and give you more realistic assumptions that will be easier to defend in front of other stakeholders. More importantly, make sure you have evaluated several scenarios like we did in the ROI calculator that I shared in the previous post. The outcome of the study will be shared with many stakeholders and they may have different views of the same world. Having these scenarios built-in shows that you are a professional and that you are not trying to sell the moon. Be open and transparent about your assumptions and how you defined them. 

### 7) Do it early, do it often

If you have read the first blog on why every Presales need to do VE, you should know that VE helps you close your deal faster and at a higher revenue. There’s no golden rule on when to use VE for a deal. Based on your sales process, you can build an opinion on when VE makes sense. Your go/nogo criteria can include deal size, access to execs and business stakeholders, the use case, etc. You can start with a fast high level study to gauge what the outcome will look like in the best and the worst scenarios and take the decision to engage or not in a more structured VE process with the customer. If you do your job correctly, it should be less expensive and time consuming to use/build/reuse/improve these tools over time.

## Do you need a Value Engineering team?

I wanted to finish this series of blogs by a question that I get asked often: do you need a dedicated VE team? 

Let me answer this as an SE would do: it depends!

I’ve seen companies going from one extreme to the other. They spend years having tech focused marketing, sales pitch and processes. Then, they want to hire a full army of VE consultants hoping that this will solve all their problems. This overnight transformation misses several points:
- VE consultants work with the account team. If the account team is not sold on value selling, they won’t engage the VE team, and the outcome will be limited.
- You need a coherent value mindset across the board. This starts from your website and how you talk about your product, to your demos and slide decks up to your sellers and presales. Having a commando team won’t change things if the rest of your organization is not aligned.
- VE consultants are, like Presales, hard to hire and expensive. This is why you will find a ratio of 1 to 15 or even 1 to 50 in terms of VE Consultant / Sales. Often, VE consultants focus on the most strategic multi-million deals. You don’t have the luxury of having them engaged in mid and low tier deals.
- VE consultants are engaged in advanced sales cycles. Lots of missed opportunities to show and talk about value in the sales cycle if Value Engineering is the responsibility of a dedicated small team..

For these reasons, I think that young organizations should start by hiring Presales that understand and believe in Value Engineering before building a dedicated Value Engineering team. This helps infuse the value culture deep in the sales organization from discovery, to demo to solution design and evaluation. Having the Presales team building, sharing and improving a value toolbox pushes the need of a dedicated Value team for later. This phase can last for years without missing a lot of opportunities. This makes sure that the foundation and the culture is ready for the next phase: hiring a dedicated VE team.

Having a dedicated team will be a natural next phase. The newly formed team can bring more sophisticated models and tools. They will help tune industry specific sales plays and take your value selling to the next level. More importantly, they will face less friction as the whole GTM team shares the same vision and practices. The VE team will be enabled to have a maximum impact. They can train presales and sellers on the new tools they build and multithread. They can pick from the Presales team Regional SMEs (Subject Matter Experts) and keep them close to the latest VE initiatives. These SMEs would cover the medium tier opportunities and leverage the VE team in a more focused and efficient way. 

## A final thought

I hope I succeeded in sharing my view on Value Engineering from Presales lenses. I hope I convinced you to invest in this field if you are not doing it already. I believe that there’s a natural bridge between Presales and Value Engineering and that’s is our responsibility as Presales to cross this bridge. Thank you for taking the time to read this blog series. I would be more than happy to hear your thoughts and feedback on the topic. 

Looking forward to hearing from you and happy selling!
